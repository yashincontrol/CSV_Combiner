# CSV Combiner

Write a command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV
file (found in the `fixtures` directory of this repo) will have the same
columns. Your script should output a new CSV file to `stdout` that contains the
rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the
filename from which the row came (only the file's basename, not the entire path).
Use `filename` as the header for the additional column.

## To Run

Run the following to output to `stdout`
```
$  python3 ./combine_csv.py ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv ./fixtures/household_cleaners.csv 

```
Run the following to output as a combined csv file
```
$  python3 ./combine_csv.py ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv ./fixtures/household_cleaners.csv > combined.csv

```
## To Run Unit Tests
```
$  python3 -m unittest test_combine_csv.py

```

## Example
Given two input files named `clothing.csv` and `accessories.csv`.
